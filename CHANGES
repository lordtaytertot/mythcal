Changes in version 0.27.0
=========================

* Update to use Calendar v3 API.

* Changes to settings in mythcal.conf:

   * The [google] section is no longer required. Credentials are stored in
     a new file, mythcal.credentials, which is set up using `mythcal --auth`.
     See the README for more information.

   * In the [calendar] section, "name" and "max_batch_size" are no longer
     required and can be removed.

* Simplify time zone handling.
