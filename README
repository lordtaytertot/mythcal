Introduction
============

mythcal is a simple script that synchronizes your MythTV recording schedule to
a Google calendar.

Leaving my MythTV server on 24/7 wastes electricity, but I don't want to forget
to turn it on to record programmes. I wrote this to make it easy to keep track
of upcoming recordings.

Getting started
===============

1. Create a calendar in Google Calendar that will hold your MythTV programmes.
   DO NOT USE YOUR MAIN GOOGLE CALENDAR! YOU MUST CREATE A NEW CALENDAR!
   mythcal synchronises your programmes by deleting everything from the
   calendar, then adding an event for each programme.

2. Create a new directory somewhere on your MythTV server and copy the script
   (mythcal) and the template configuration file (mythcal.conf.template) into
   the directory.

3. Install the required packages:

    * MythTV Python bindings ("libmyth-python" for Ubuntu; "python-MythTV"
      from RPM Fusion free for Fedora).

    * pytz ("python-tz" for Debian and Ubuntu; "pytz" for Fedora).

    * Google Data Python Client Library ("python-gdata" for Debian/Ubuntu/
      Fedora).

4. Copy the template configuration file, mythcal.conf.template, to
   mythcal.conf, and add the missing settings. The sections are:

    * [mythtv] - details about your MythTV server. "timezone" should be a
      zoneinfo time zone name such as "Europe/London". To find an appropriate
      time zone name, use the supplied 'timezones' script (see below).

    * [google] - your Google username and password.

    * [calendar] - details about your Google Calendar. "name" means the
      name of the calendar. To find the "id", go into Google Calendar Settings,
      open the "Calendars" tab, click the calendar you want to use, and look
      in the "Calendar Address" section. The Calendar ID should be displayed:
      it will look something like "abc123def@group.calendar.google.com". Please
      remember: USE A SEPARATE CALENDAR FOR MYTHCAL, or your appointments will
      be deleted! "max_batch_size" is the maximum number of events that will be
      combined into a single batch request when adding events. 25 should be OK.

5. Run mythcal manually with the "--dry-run" or "-n" option. This will tell you
   what's going to be changed in your Google Calendar. Hopefully it won't tell
   you that your important appointments are going to be deleted, because you'll
   be using a *separate* calendar for mythcal!

6. If everything looks good, set up a cron job which will execute mythcal as
   often as you like. The command being run should look something like this:

     cd /path/to/mythcal/directory && ./mythcal

Finding an appropriate time zone name
=====================================

The 'timezones' script can be used to find an appropriate time zone name.
Running it with no parameters lists all time zone names. If a parameter is
given, the script does a case-insensitive search for time zones containing
that text. For example:

    $ ./timezones york
    America/New_York

of the MythTV Python bindings.
